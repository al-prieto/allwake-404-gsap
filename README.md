# ALLWAKE – 404 Interactive Page

A single-screen 404 page built as a motion and interaction exercise, focused on translating visual motion design into clean, performant front-end code using GSAP.

This project is part of the **ALLWAKE** personal brand and explores animation timing, sequencing, and UI polish rather than complex layouts or multi-page navigation.

## Overview

The project started from a visual walkthrough created in **Figma**, followed by a motion prototype in **Jitter** to study timing and flow.  
From there, the experience was rebuilt from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, adapting the animation logic for the web.

The original character was replaced with a **custom alpaca video generated using AI**, integrated directly into the layout and animation flow.
